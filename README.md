This is a program that is run at the command line, that accepts two fractions, numbers, or mixed numbers, and one of the four basic operands (plus, minus, times, and divide) and computes the operation returning the number, fraction in its most reduced form (e.g. 3/6 -> Â½) or mixed number in its reduced form converting improper fractions to mixed numbers (e.g. 14/8 -> 1_3/4).

There is also an api component, which collects the arguments through a REST API. It accepts the arguments to a single endpoint and returns the result over HTTP.

For directions on how the program runs, please reference directions.txt
